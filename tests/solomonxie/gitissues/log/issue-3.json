You can extract data from responses and set variable values automatically. You can chain requests one after the other with minimal effort. Variable values are also available inside tests to help you make them more generic.\r\n\r\nData variables let you test multiple instances of a request in one go. Imagine that you want to test an API which let's users post comments on a post. Using data variables you can test for hundreds of variations of a request with different IDs, tokens or content bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's look at how you can use variables in your workflow inside Postman.\r\n\r\nCreate an environment\r\n\r\nFor this example, let's assume we want to create two environments, production and dev.\r\n\r\nClick on \"No environment\" in the header.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14041622/35851658-9f210762-0b63-11e8-86a6-327eb0c3119d.png)\r\n\r\n2.
